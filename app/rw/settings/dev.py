#Your project will probably also have static assets that arenâ€™t tied to a particular app.
#In addition to using a static/ directory inside your apps, you can define a list of directories (STATICFILES_DIRS) in your settings file where Django will also look for static files. For example:
STATICFILES_DIRS = [os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static'),
'/app/static/']
